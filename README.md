# GitNotes

My personal notes for common Git CLI tasks. 

## Getting Started with GitHub
---

### Overview
1. Create new SSH key on dev machine and add it to ssh-agent  
https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/#platform-linux  

2. Add SSH key to GitHub Profile  
https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/#platform-linux  

3. Clone the Repo  

4. Set the origin remote URL.
If clone was done via HTTPS, need to set-url. If clone was done via SSH, skip this step.
```
	git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/your-repository.git
```
## The Basics
---

### Cloning
Used to copy from repository to repository. Commonly used to clone from a remote cloud repo such as GitHub or GitLab to a local repository.
```
	git clone ssh://user@example.com/project.git /directory/path
```	
### Committing
Used to commit changes to the local repository.

You have to add the changes to the staging area first:
```
	git add filename.ext
```	
You can then commit the changes:
```
	git commit
```	
If you want to commit a snapshot of all changes in the working directory (everything that has been previouly added):
```
	git commit -a
```	
If you want to commit with a comment (you should):
```
	git commit -m "Change summary"
```	
If you want to combine the snapshot with a comment:
```
	git commit -am "Change summary"
```	
### Pushing
Used to push commits to a remote branch.
```
	git push <remote> <branch>
```	
### Pulling
Used to merge changes from remote repo to the local repo.
```
	git pull <remote>
```
## Advanced
---

### Basic rebase
If remote repo is a commit ahead of the local repo --rebase will allow you to pull the changes from the remote and stack your changes on top. Commonly used for resolving merge/push conflicts:
```
	git pull --rebase origin
```	
### Branches
If you want to create a new feature you can create a new branch of a repository commit to it separately from the master branch. You can then use a pull request to merge the branch into master.

The first thing to do is create (`-b` flag) and checkout the new branch from master:
```
	git checkout -b newfeature
```	
To make changes in the new branch, you can use `git status` to verify the branch that you're in and then commit and push changes same as before.

When you're ready, you can push your changes to the remote repo. Use the `-u` flag to add it as a remote tracking branch.
```
	git push -u origin newfeature
```	
Since the branch was configured as a tracking branch you can use the standard `git push` moving forward. From there you can go into the repo management tool (GitHub, GitLab, etc.) and issue a Pull Request to merge the 'newfeature' branch into 'master'.

##### Merging a Branch
To merge a branch into master, you'll have to use `checkout` to move back to master branch, `pull` to grab the latest changes, `pull` the branch in, and then `push` the changes back to the remote repo.
```
	git checkout master
	git pull
	git pull origin newfeature
	git push
```
